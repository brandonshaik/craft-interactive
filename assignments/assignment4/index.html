              <p id="first" class="story">Earlier this month, New York City Schools Chancellor Carmen Fariña announced the expansion and addition of 29 dual-language programs, where both English and non-native English speaking students are taught subjects in both languages, beginning this fall.</p>
                </br>
              <p class="story">Being able to speak multiple languages is “a gift, it’s a pleasure, it’s something that’s going to make you much more employable,” Fariña said at the High School for Dual Language and Asian Studies, where she announced the expansion. “More importantly, it’s going to make you a citizen of the world.”</p>
                </br>
              <p class="story">Between 2010 and 2014, high school graduation rates for non-native English speakers dropped from 41.5 percent to 32.5 percent, while overall graduation rates increased. Kate Menken, Co-Principal Investigator of the CUNY-New York State Initiative for Emergent Bilinguals Project, attributes this drop to the No Child Left Behind Act, which she says pressured schools into a testing focused curriculum that did not cater to non-native English speakers. </p>
                </br>
              <p class="story">“It was the most invasive federal education policy we had ever seen and the law itself destroyed the bilingual education act which had preceded it," Menken said.</p>
                </br>
            </div>
            <div class="large-3 medium-6 small-12 columns" >
              <p class="story">But, now that the no child left behind act is being abandoned for a new policy that gives more power back to the states, there is an opportunity to turn the tides for the large population of English language learners in the city.  While the vast majority of the programs in the city are transitional bilingual programs aimed at quickly moving bilingual students into English only classrooms, a large body of research has shown that there are many positive outcomes related to dual language programs towards which the city is transitioning.  Studies have shown that students enrolled in such programs have demonstrated higher cognitive flexibility and improved literacy rates when compared to students enrolled in traditional programs.</p>
                </br>
              <p class="story">Because of that, the city has seen spiking interest for such programs from families of all backgrounds. Gaining a spot in one of these programs is competative; One program had 1,100 applicants for 20 spots. Parents are becoming more aware of the benefits dual-language classrooms have to offer and perceive them as enrichment programs that can better prepare their children for the globalized world of today.</p>
