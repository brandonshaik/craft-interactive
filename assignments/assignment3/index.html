                  <p>Every day, hundreds of thousands of New York City public school children sit in class hungry, unable to focus because they can’t afford lunch.</p>

                  <p>Parents, teachers and advocacy groups are calling on Mayor Bill de Blasio to implement a universal free lunch program in public schools after he emphasized the need for such a program during his 2013 reelection campaign. Following the release of this year’s budget, de Blasio is being criticized for not funding a free lunch program again.</p>

                  <p>Liz Accles, Executive Director of Community Food Advocates, a nonprofit organization that promotes federal food programs, said she believes universal free lunch in New York City is a necessity that many students don’t utilize because of the poverty stigma associated with the program.</p>

                  <p>“There are many children who are eligible for free or reduced price lunch that don’t participate because of [the poverty stigma], despite the need. There are also other students whose family income is above the income cutoff but still are struggling. This is something that would just remove that structural inequity that has been around for decades,” she said.</p>

                  <p>While about 25 percent of children in New York City qualify for free or reduced lunch, many don’t utilize the program because of the stigma associated with being poor. The No Kid Hungry Campaign, a New York City advocacy group, reports that only 34 percent of students eligible for free or reduced lunch also receive free breakfast, which is included in the program.</p>

            <p>Universal lunch programs currently exist in what are called stand-alone middle schools, meaning that they only have grades 6 through 8. Schools that have grades from kindergarten through eighth, or eighth through twelfth don’t have universal free lunch programs. The program in stand-alone schools is part of a pilot program implemented by the city.</p>

            <p>Of the 141 schools that include sixth, seventh or eight grade, 93 are not considered stand alone, meaning that they do not participate in the free lunch program. View the map below to see the stand alone schools and non-stand alone schools.</p>

            <p>“Given the high percentages of students whose families remain in poverty, food and getting adequate nutrition is a major struggle,” Accles said. “This is something that across the board, with the swipe of a pen, will make life easier for many children in the New York City public schools.”</p>
