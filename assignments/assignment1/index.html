<div class="story"><p>Since the start of the subway system in 112 years ago, Brooklynites trying to make their way to Queens have always had to make a detour into Manhattan, but Mayor Bill de Blasio is aiming to cut out the middleman with a proposed above ground railway, the Brooklyn Queens Connector (BQX). However, the proposed route may not serve those who need it most.</p>

<p>The 16-mile railway, lauded for its skyline views, is slated to stretch along the East River through Brooklyn Heights, DUMBO, Long Island City and Astoria, to name a few. Despite the praise that the $2.5 billion project has received, the projected route runs through more affluent neighborhoods that are some of the least populated in New York City.</p>

<p>Mayor de Blasio's route is intended to bring better transportation to parts of New York that some feel are underserved. However, the proposed route doesn't offer much for residents of Bushwick, Ridgewood or Jackson Heights, which have a large population density and low median income.</p>

<p>"The center of gravity is shifting more and more to the outer boroughs, and particularly to our two most populous boroughs. And so we've got to answer that with a new kind of transportation," said Mayor de Blasio in a press conference on Tuesday in Red Hook, where the route will run through. </p>

<p>"I think that the route that's been announced passes through both affluent and non-affluent neighborhoods. The route was designed to serve waterfront communities that don't necessarily have the best service right now," said Robert Perris, District Manager of Community Board 2 in Brooklyn, which include Fort Greene, Downtown Brooklyn, Dumbo and Vinegar Hill.</p>

<p>"The city is making massive investments into jobs along this route and we are going to see an increase in housing in the coming years...these neighborhoods are the backbone of the new New York economy," said Wiley Norvell, Communications Advisor for the Mayor's Office of Housing and Economic Development.</p>

<p>Norvel said the proposed route is not set in stone, and will be finalized after a series of community meetings, emphasizing that investing into this project is not taking away from other transportation related projects in the city.</p>
